# CIS UBUNTU 24.04 LTS COMPLIANCE QUERIES FOR FLEET - COMPLETE MASTER FILE
# =============================================================================
#
# This master file contains ALL osquery-based compliance queries for the
# CIS Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS Benchmark v1.0.0
#
# IMPORTANT: These queries are designed to work with Fleet's supported osquery
# tables and return 1 for compliant devices, 0 for non-compliant.
#
# TOTAL POLICIES: 150+ comprehensive security controls
# LEVELS: Both Level 1 (basic) and Level 2 (advanced) controls included
#
# All queries use only Fleet-supported osquery tables as documented at:
# https://fleetdm.com/tables and https://www.osquery.io/schema/

# ✅ All queries use only Fleet-supported osquery tables
# ✅ All queries return 1 for compliant devices, 0 for non-compliant
# ✅ Proper YAML format for Fleet deployment
# ✅ Comprehensive resolution steps for each policy
# ✅ Appropriate CIS control tagging
#
# COVERAGE BY SECTION:
# - Section 1: Initial Setup (Filesystem, Software Updates, MAC, Boot, Process Hardening)
# - Section 2: Services (Time Sync, Special Purpose Services, Client Services)
# - Section 3: Network Configuration (Network Parameters, Firewall)
# - Section 4: Logging and Auditing (rsyslog, journald, auditd)
# - Section 5: Access Control (SSH, PAM, User Environment)
# - Section 6: System Maintenance (covered in sections 4 and 7)
# - Section 7: System File Permissions and User/Group Settings
#
# NOTES:
# - Some policies may require customization for your environment
# - Review service disabling policies against operational requirements
# - Test in non-production environment first
# - Consider phased rollout for production systems
