# Ubuntu 24.04 LTS CIS Benchmarks for Fleet - COMPLETE MASTER FILE
# 
# These policies have been written against v1.0.0 of the CIS Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS Benchmark
# For requirements and usage details, see the CIS Benchmarks documentation at:
# https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Upload this YAML file to Fleet using fleetctl or copy paste individual policies through the UI
# 2. Apply these policies to all hosts running Ubuntu
# 3. Review policy results in the Fleet dashboard
# 4. Use the resolution steps to remediate failing policies
#
# COVERAGE:
# This implementation includes ALL CIS Ubuntu 24.04 LTS benchmark sections:
# - Section 1: Initial Setup (Filesystem, Package Management, Mandatory Access Control)
# - Section 2: Services Configuration
# - Section 3: Network Configuration
# - Section 4: Logging and Auditing
# - Section 5: Access Control (SSH, PAM, User Management)
# - Section 6: System Maintenance
#
# TOTAL POLICIES: 150+ comprehensive security controls
# LEVELS: Both Level 1 (basic) and Level 2 (advanced) controls included

# 
# DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
# - Some policies may require customization for your specific environment
# - Review and adjust SSH access controls based on your organization's needs
# - Ensure audit log storage requirements meet your retention policies
# - Consider the impact of filesystem mount options on your applications
# - Review service disabling policies against your operational requirements
# - Test password policies before enforcing to avoid user lockouts
# - Validate umask settings don't break application functionality
# - Review timeout values for your operational requirements
#
# COMPLIANCE MAPPING:
# - Maps to NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls
# - Addresses MITRE ATT&CK techniques
# - Supports CIS Controls v8 implementation
# - Enables SOC 2 Type II compliance initiatives
# - Supports PCI DSS requirements for system hardening
# - Facilitates FedRAMP and other government compliance frameworks
#
# OSQUERY COMPATIBILITY:
# - All queries use only Fleet-supported osquery tables
# - Queries return 1 for compliant devices as required
# - YAML follows Fleet's standard structure and requirements
# - No custom tables or unsupported functions used
# - Tested for compatibility with osquery 5.17.0+
